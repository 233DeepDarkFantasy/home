# Foundamentals and Practice of Software Engineering with Python

* If you have concerns about the course, please email to me or open [the github issue](https://github.com/PySEE/home/issues). I value all suggestions.
 
    * Email: cmh@seu.edu.cn. 

## Goal

This course is intended to train **students majored in thermal energy engineering** in good software skills for producing code.

We will cover: 

* writing clean, testable, high quality code in Python
* interactive analysis and literate programming with the IPython Notebook
* a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques
* computational tools to model and understand data(numpy, matplotlib, scipy)
* debug programs using a standardized approach
* write unit tests and evaluate software quality
* use version control 
* C/C++ progamming with GCC

### Required Materials and Textbooks

* A laptop computer will be needed in the classroom.

## Using Git

We **recommend** that you use [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases) to **clone** and **update** this repository.

After you have installed **git**, You may use the following **commands:**

### Cloning to Your Computer

When you clone a repository you set up a copy on your computer. Run:

```bash
>git clone https://github.com/PySEE/home.git
```

This will create a folder **home** on your computer, with the files in subdirectories.

### Updating to The Latest Version

As we release new files, or if we update an already released files, you'll have to update your repository.

You can do this by changing into the **home** directory and executing:

```bash
>git pull
```
That's it - you'll have the latest version of the repository.

>you may also use any GUI git client to clone and update this repository, for example:  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ,or  [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## TIPS

We highly recommend you practice coding whenever you have a few minutes.

You **NEED** to **get your hands dirty** and **practice**
