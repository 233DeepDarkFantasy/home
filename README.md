
## Foundamentals and Practice of Software Engineering with Python

If you have concerns about the course, please email(cmh@seu.edu.cn) to me or open [the github issue](https://github.com/PySEE/home/issues). I value all suggestions.
 
### Goal

This course is intended to train **students majored in thermal energy engineering** in good software skills for producing code.

We will cover: 

* writing clean, testable, high quality code in [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* interactive analysis and literate programming with the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)
* training [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) to model and solve the complex problems
* **computational tools** to model and understand data [Numpy, Scipy,Matplotlib](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [debug programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) using a standardized approach
* write [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and evaluate software quality
* C/C++ programming with [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* Version control with [Git/Github](https://git-scm.com/) 

### Required Materials

* A laptop **computer** will be needed in the classroom.

* **[Softwares](./guide/BuildingSoftwareEnvironment.md)**

   * Python, Jupyter,Numpy,Scipy,Matplotlib，Visual Studio Code,IAPWS,SEUIF97
   
   * GCC,GSL,Gnuplot
   
   * Git,Github

### Using the Notebooks of PySEE/home 

#### Download the Files of  PySEE/home to Your Computer 

You can manually download the `home.zip` file of the `PySEE/home` to your computer

![download](./guide/img/downloadhome.jpg)

### Open the Notebooks of PySEE/home in Jupyter Notebook

Unzip **home.zip**.In the sub-folder of **notebook** of home, double-click `StartNB.bat`(OS:Windows) or run the command:`jupyter notebook` in a terminal. This will open a web page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks.

>We **recommend** that you [use git to clone and update the home repositoriey.](./guide/BuildingSoftwareEnvironment.md#e-using-git)

### TIPS

We highly recommend you practice coding whenever you have a few minutes.

You **NEED** to **get your hands dirty** and **practice**
